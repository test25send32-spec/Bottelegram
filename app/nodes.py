"""Multi-node coordination.

Two roles share one codebase (see config.ROLE):

- **main**: owns the database and the dashboard. It pushes each user's config
  to the node the user is assigned to, so that node runs Xray for them.
- **node**: runs Xray for the users the main panel pushed to it, and reports
  their traffic usage back to the main panel.

Authentication is either a shared secret (TITAN_NODE_SECRET, legacy/simple) or
a per-node token issued by the main panel's "Quick node setup" wizard
(TITAN_NODE_TOKEN on the node side). With a token, a node can self-register:
it reports its own public URL to the main panel, so the admin never has to copy
domains around or keep a shared secret in sync.
